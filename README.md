# Coffee Making Machine PLC Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) project for a coffee making machine. This project aims to develop the control logic and functionality for a coffee making machine using a PLC.

## Overview

In this project, I am utilizing a PLC to control various aspects of a coffee making machine such as:

- Brewing process control
- Ingredient dispensing (water, coffee powder)
- User interface interaction

## Features

- **Automated Brewing**: The PLC controls the entire brewing process, from dispensing the right amount of water to brewing the coffee.

- **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in safety features to prevent accidents and ensure user safety.
